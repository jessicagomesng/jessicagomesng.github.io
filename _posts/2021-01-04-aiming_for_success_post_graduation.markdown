I'm just about done with my final project, and I'm starting to dive into the wonderful world of job hunting and job preparation! My brain still feels like it's swimming with all of the things I've learned, but I wanted to create a list of my five goals for post-graduation to keep myself accountable and motivated.

*1. Deploy my apps to Heroku*

Currently, all of my applications are still only available locally. I want to deploy all of the applications in my portfolio to Heroku -- not only will this give me a new skill to add to my resume, it'll also make linking to them much easier! I've just learned how to do this today... think I'm going to write my next blog post about this as it took me a while to get through all of the steps and figure out what I was doing!

*2. Write blog posts*

Flatiron emphasises this so much, and I didn't really understand its importance until recently. I've started browsing Medium a lot more and generally reading different blog posts whenever I'm stuck on something. Blog posts from other developers have helped me *so* much over the past few months, so, more than anything, I want to also be contributing to the community I'm learning from and (hopefully) giving back in some way! Honestly, sometimes I feel a little embarrassed to write blog posts because it feels like there are so many other developers out there and the things I might want to write about seem so simple! I just have to remind myself that I often am looking for simple guides myself, so there's got to be a use for them in the ether! :) 

*3. Learn new skills!*

I have so many new skills I want to learn! Coding makes my brain hurt a little because I'm looking ahead and realising how much more there is I want to know. I want to learn Python, continue to expand my understanding of data structures/algorithms, keep learning React and especially the newer versions of it that use hooks...I also feel like I've only just dipped my toe into Rails, and I want to develop those skills even more too! It never ends!!

*4. Add to my portfolio*

This ties in to my previous point, but I think the best way to learn and grow (and also show what you know) is to actually build projects and code! There's only so much I can read from documentation. I want to add a couple of projects to my portfolio and to keep expanding it. I have some ideas, but don't want to spoil anything -- stay tuned for updates! 

*5. Practice!*

Pretty obvious, butt practice makes perfect :) I want to make it a priority to try and do a little bit of coding or practicing every day -- I have some big personal life changes coming up that will definitely change how much time I have, but I'm really hoping to do a little a day, whether that be building a new app from scratch or simply studying one or two algorithm problems! 


This isn't an exhaustive list at all, and I know Flatiron has so many other suggestions/requirements for post-grad sucess. On the one hand, I'm excited to have kind of an open agenda to learn whatever I want to and keep exploring the different things that interest me, but, on the other hand, I'm feeling overwhelmed without a clearly defined road map. There's so much to do and learn! I'm looking forward to seeing where I am in just a month from now, let alone a year or two :)
