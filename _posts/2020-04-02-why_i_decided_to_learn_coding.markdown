When I was seven, my older sister and I discovered a website called Xanga (a blog-hosting website -- think Tumblr meets Wordpress). I don't know why we got so into it, but we spent hours of our summer holiday poring over pages of HTML/CSS and crafting our own blog templates complete with their own bubbly, glittery fonts, animated cursors, and colour schemes. Eventually, summer ended, we went back to school, and I tucked away my newfound knowledge of hexadecimal codes into a corner of my brain. 

My (limited) knowledge of HTML/CSS resurfaced when I was graduating university and it was time to create a website for myself. I became curious about coding again as I tinkered with my site's existing layout. Then, a few months later, during a maths tuition session, my student told me about W3 Schools. He mentioned he'd learned to code there, and he recommended I check it out. Later that week, I went on the website and started doing some of the listed exercises -- there turned out to be much more to HTML/CSS than I'd learned during my Xanga days, and, moreover, there were numerous other languages that I wanted to pick up on! My sister had already finished a degree in Computer Science, and she told me I could easily learn coding on my own. So, I started doing some research, found out about a few bootcamps, and decided to apply!

Anyway, that brings us to the here and now! I decided to pursue coding because I've always been the kind of person who isn't satisfied by simply being handed a finished product -- I'm someone who wants to get under the hood of things, learn how they work, and then build them myself. I constantly use apps on my phone or browse the Internet and find myself wondering at the sheer innovation of it all. I want to move away from just wondering to actually understanding how those technologies work -- and creating them myself!

Currently, I work as a musical theatre actress, although that work is currently on pause for an indeterminate amount of time until coronavirus concerns begin to fade :'(  I do absolutely love my job, but I'm looking to move into having a primary career that is stable and predictable so that I'm able to continue musical theatre without constantly stressing about where my next paycheck will be coming from. I want to learn as much as I can through this coding course and am very excited to see where it takes me!
